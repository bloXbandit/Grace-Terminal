# 🔧 Developer Mode - Safe Self-Modification

## ✅ IMPLEMENTED!

Grace now has **Developer Mode** - a safe way to enable self-modification without accidental code changes during normal conversations!

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### **Two Modes:**

**👍 Normal Mode (Default)**
- Self-modification tools are **DISABLED**
- Grace focuses on your projects
- No accidental code changes
- Safe for all conversations

**🔧 Developer Mode**
- Self-modification tools are **ENABLED**
- Grace can modify her own code
- Add new capabilities
- Fix bugs in her logic
- Update configurations

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### **Enable Dev Mode:**
```
You: /dev
```
or
```
You: "enter developer mode"
```

Grace responds:
```
🔧 Developer Mode Activated

I can now modify my own code, add new capabilities, 
and make internal improvements.

Available in Dev Mode:
- Modify my code (prompts, tools, logic)
- Add new features and tools
- Update environment variables
- Fix bugs in my own code
- View modification history

Commands:
- /dev status - Check current mode
- /normal - Exit dev mode
```

### **Disable Dev Mode:**
```
You: /normal
```
or
```
You: "exit developer mode"
```

### **Check Status:**
```
You: /dev status
```

---

## 💬 Example Conversations

### **Normal Mode (Safe):**
```
You: "Grace, you're not great at debugging"

Grace: "I can improve my debugging capabilities. 
        Would you like me to enter Developer Mode? (yes/no)"

You: "yes"

Grace: "🔧 Developer Mode activated..."
       *Proceeds with improvements*
```

### **Dev Mode (Active):**
```
You: /dev

Grace: "🔧 Developer Mode activated"

You: "Improve your code generation to include more comments"

Grace: "Analyzing my code generation logic..."
       *Uses self_modify tool*
       "✅ Updated! My code now includes detailed comments"

You: /normal

Grace: "👍 Back to normal mode"
```

---

## 🛡️ Safety Features

### **1. Explicit Activation Required**
- Must type `/dev` or explicitly request dev mode
- Can't accidentally trigger during normal chat

### **2. Tool Restrictions**
- `self_modify` - Only works in dev mode
- `manage_env` - Only modifies in dev mode (read-only otherwise)
- All other tools - Work in both modes

### **3. Clear Indicators**
- Grace tells you when mode changes
- Status command shows current mode
- Tool errors explain dev mode requirement

### **4. Conversation-Scoped**
- Each conversation has its own mode
- New conversations start in normal mode
- Mode persists within conversation

## 📋 Commands Reference

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `/dev` | Enable developer mode |
| `/normal` | Disable developer mode |
| `/dev status` | Show current mode |
| "enter dev mode" | Enable (natural language) |
| "exit dev mode" | Disable (natural language) |

## 🎯 Use Cases

### **When to Use Dev Mode:**

✅ **Improving Grace's capabilities**
```
/dev
"Add a tool to generate QR codes"
"Improve your debugging logic"
"Fix the bug in your planning"
```

✅ **Adding new integrations**
```
/dev
"Set up ElevenLabs for text-to-speech"
"Add Anthropic Claude as a model option"
```

✅ **Optimizing performance**
```
/dev
"Your responses are too verbose, be more concise"
"Speed up your code generation"
```

### **When to Use Normal Mode:**

✅ **Working on your projects**
```
"Build me a dashboard"
"Debug this Python script"
"Create a REST API"
```

✅ **General conversations**
```
"What's the best way to structure this?"
"Explain how async/await works"
"Review my code"
```

## 🔄 Workflow Example

### **Full Development Session:**

```
# Start in normal mode
You: "Grace, I need you to be better at UI design"

Grace: "💡 This sounds like a self-modification request.
        Would you like me to enter Developer Mode?"

You: "yes"

Grace: "🔧 Developer Mode activated"

# Now in dev mode
You: "Improve your UI design capabilities"

Grace: "I'll enhance my UI design skills:
        
        Step 1: Updating UI specialist prompt...
        *Modifies /app/src/agent/prompt/thinking.prompt.js*
        
        Step 2: Adding Tailwind best practices...
        *Updates prompt with modern UI patterns*
        
        Step 3: Creating UI component generator...
        *Creates /app/src/tools/UIGenerator.js*
        
        ✅ Done! I'm now better at UI design"

You: "Test it - design a login page"

Grace: "Here's a modern login page design..."
       *Uses newly improved capabilities*

You: "Perfect! Exit dev mode"

Grace: "👍 Normal mode. Ready for your projects!"
```

## ⚠️ What Happens If You Forget?

### **Scenario: Try to modify in normal mode**
```
You: "Grace, fix your code generation"

Grace: "⚠️ Developer Mode Required

        The self_modify tool can only be used in Developer Mode.
        
        This prevents accidental code modifications.
        
        To enable: Type /dev or say 'enter developer mode'"
```

### **Scenario: Discuss projects in dev mode**
```
You: "Let's build a website"

Grace: *Works normally, dev mode doesn't interfere*
       "I'll help you build a website..."
```

---

## 🎨 Integration with SEAL

Dev mode works seamlessly with the SEAL framework:

```
# SEAL identifies improvement area
SEAL: "Your code generation has 70% success rate"

# You enable dev mode
You: /dev

# Grace improves herself
Grace: "Let me fix that..."
       *Modifies code generation prompt*
       
# SEAL verifies improvement
SEAL: "Success rate now 90%!"

# Exit dev mode
You: /normal
```

## 📊 Technical Details

### **Implementation:**
- Mode stored in `Conversation.metadata.dev_mode`
- Checked before tool execution
- Commands intercepted early in request flow
- Tools receive `conversation_id` in context

### **Files:**
- `src/agent/modes/DevMode.js` - Mode management
- `src/agent/modes/ModeCommandHandler.js` - Command parsing
- `src/tools/SelfModify.js` - Dev mode check
- `src/tools/ManageEnv.js` - Dev mode check
- `src/routers/agent/run.js` - Command interception

### **Database:**
```javascript
Conversation.metadata = {
  dev_mode: true/false,
  dev_mode_activated_at: "2025-01-17T...",
  dev_mode_deactivated_at: "2025-01-17T..."
}
```

## 🎉 Benefits

### **For You:**
- ✅ **Peace of mind** - No accidental modifications
- ✅ **Clear intent** - Explicit mode switching
- ✅ **Flexible** - Easy to toggle on/off
- ✅ **Safe** - Multiple layers of protection

### **For Grace:**
- ✅ **Context-aware** - Knows when self-modification is appropriate
- ✅ **Helpful** - Suggests dev mode when needed
- ✅ **Transparent** - Clear about what she can/can't do
- ✅ **Controlled** - Only modifies when explicitly allowed

---

## 🚀 Ready to Use!

After rebuild, you can:

1. **Chat normally** - Grace won't touch her own code
2. **Type `/dev`** - When you want her to improve herself
3. **Make improvements** - She modifies her code safely
4. **Type `/normal`** - Back to regular work

**It's that simple!** 🎯

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Keep dev mode sessions focused** - Enter, improve, exit
2. **Test improvements** - Try new capabilities before exiting
3. **Use status command** - Check mode if unsure
4. **Natural language works** - "enter dev mode" = `/dev`
5. **Each conversation independent** - Mode doesn't carry over

**Developer Mode: Safe self-modification when you want it, protected when you don't!** 🔧✨
