# Document Generation - Complete Fix

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed - Libraries Added + Execution Validated

---

## üéØ Problem Identified

**Root Cause:** Runtime Docker container was missing document generation libraries!

### **What Was Missing:**
- ‚ùå No `python-docx` (for Word documents)
- ‚ùå No `openpyxl` (for Excel files)
- ‚ùå No `pandas` (for CSV/data manipulation)
- ‚ùå No `reportlab` or `fpdf2` (for PDF generation)

The `browser_server/requirements.txt` only had browser-use dependencies. When Grace tried to create documents, Python would fail with "ModuleNotFoundError".

---

## ‚úÖ Fixes Applied

### **1. Added Document Generation Libraries**

**File:** `browser_server/requirements.txt`

```python
# Document Generation Libraries
python-docx>=1.1.0      # Word documents (.docx)
openpyxl>=3.1.2         # Excel spreadsheets (.xlsx)
pandas>=2.2.0           # CSV and data manipulation
reportlab>=4.0.0        # Advanced PDF generation
fpdf2>=2.7.0            # Simple PDF generation
Pillow>=10.2.0          # Image handling for documents
```

**Impact:** Grace can now create:
- ‚úÖ Word documents (.docx)
- ‚úÖ Excel spreadsheets (.xlsx)
- ‚úÖ PDF files (.pdf)
- ‚úÖ CSV files (.csv)
- ‚úÖ JSON files (.json)
- ‚úÖ Text files (.txt)

---

### **2. Updated data_generation Specialist Prompt**

**File:** `src/agent/specialists/routing.config.js`

**Changes:**
1. ‚úÖ Explicitly states libraries are pre-installed
2. ‚úÖ Provides working code examples
3. ‚úÖ Emphasizes using `terminal_run` tool
4. ‚úÖ Requires file verification after creation
5. ‚úÖ Tells actual file path (not "desktop")

**New Prompt Structure:**
```javascript
**CRITICAL: LIBRARIES ARE INSTALLED**
The following Python libraries are pre-installed in the runtime:
- python-docx (for .docx files)
- openpyxl (for .xlsx files)
- pandas (for .csv and data manipulation)
- fpdf2 (for .pdf files)
- reportlab (for advanced PDFs)

**EXECUTION STEPS:**
1. Generate content in ENGLISH ONLY
2. Use correct file format ("Word doc" = .docx, "Excel" = .xlsx)
3. Use terminal_run tool - Write Python script and execute it
4. Verify file creation - Check with ls command
5. Tell actual path - "./workspace/Conversation_XXXXX/filename.ext"

**Example for Word document:**
Use terminal_run with this Python code:
```python
from docx import Document
doc = Document()
doc.add_heading('My Document', 0)
doc.add_paragraph('This is the content in English...')
doc.save('random_document.docx')
print('‚úÖ Created: random_document.docx')
```

**CRITICAL: ALWAYS VERIFY**
After creating file, run: ls -lh filename.ext to verify it exists.
```

---

### **3. Created DocumentGenerator Tool (Optional Enhancement)**

**File:** `src/tools/DocumentGenerator.js`

A dedicated tool that:
- ‚úÖ Validates libraries are installed
- ‚úÖ Generates Python scripts for each format
- ‚úÖ Executes scripts in runtime
- ‚úÖ Verifies file was created
- ‚úÖ Returns actual file path

**Usage:**
```javascript
{
  "tool": "generate_document",
  "params": {
    "format": "docx",
    "filename": "my_document",
    "content": {
      "title": "My Document",
      "body": "Content here..."
    }
  }
}
```

**Note:** This tool is optional. The specialist can also use `terminal_run` directly with Python code (which is simpler and already working).

## üß™ Testing Document Generation

### **Test 1: Word Document**
```
üë§ User: "make a random word document"
ü§ñ Grace: [Executes Python with python-docx]
        "‚úÖ Created Word document at ./workspace/Conversation_XXXXX/random_document.docx"
```

**Verification:**
```bash
cd Grace-Terminal/workspace/Conversation_XXXXX/
ls -lh random_document.docx
file random_document.docx  # Should show: Microsoft Word 2007+
```

---

### **Test 2: Excel Spreadsheet**
```
üë§ User: "create an excel file with 10 random products and prices"
ü§ñ Grace: [Executes Python with openpyxl]
        "‚úÖ Created Excel spreadsheet at ./workspace/Conversation_XXXXX/products.xlsx"
```

**Verification:**
```bash
cd Grace-Terminal/workspace/Conversation_XXXXX/
ls -lh products.xlsx
file products.xlsx  # Should show: Microsoft Excel 2007+
```

---

### **Test 3: PDF Document**
```
üë§ User: "generate a PDF with a title and some text"
ü§ñ Grace: [Executes Python with fpdf2]
        "‚úÖ Created PDF at ./workspace/Conversation_XXXXX/document.pdf"
```

**Verification:**
```bash
cd Grace-Terminal/workspace/Conversation_XXXXX/
ls -lh document.pdf
file document.pdf  # Should show: PDF document
```

---

### **Test 4: CSV File**
```
üë§ User: "make a CSV with 5 countries and their populations"
ü§ñ Grace: [Executes Python with pandas]
        "‚úÖ Created CSV at ./workspace/Conversation_XXXXX/countries.csv"
```

**Verification:**
```bash
cd Grace-Terminal/workspace/Conversation_XXXXX/
cat countries.csv  # Should show CSV data
```

---

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### **Step 1: Pull Latest Code**
```bash
cd Grace-Terminal
git pull origin main
```

### **Step 2: Rebuild Docker Container**
**CRITICAL:** You MUST rebuild the Docker container to install the new Python libraries!

```bash
make rebuild
# or
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up -d
```

**Why Rebuild is Required:**
- The new libraries in `requirements.txt` are installed during Docker build
- Without rebuild, the runtime container won't have python-docx, openpyxl, etc.
- Grace will still fail with "ModuleNotFoundError"

### **Step 3: Verify Libraries are Installed**
```bash
docker-compose exec runtime python3 -c "import docx; import openpyxl; import pandas; import fpdf; print('‚úÖ All libraries installed')"
```

Expected output: `‚úÖ All libraries installed`

If you see errors, the container wasn't rebuilt properly.

## üìä Expected Behavior

### **Before Fix:**
```
üë§ User: "make a word document"
ü§ñ Grace: [Tries to execute Python]
‚ùå Error: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'docx'
ü§ñ Grace: "Task exception terminated: LLM Call Failed"
```

### **After Fix:**
```
üë§ User: "make a word document"
ü§ñ Grace: [Executes Python with python-docx]
‚úÖ Grace: "Created Word document at ./workspace/Conversation_XXXXX/random_document.docx"
üìÑ File exists and is valid .docx format
```

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### **Issue: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'docx'"**
**Cause:** Docker container not rebuilt  
**Fix:**
```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up -d
```

### **Issue: File created but wrong format (e.g., .md instead of .docx)**
**Cause:** Specialist not following format instructions  
**Fix:** Already updated specialist prompt to emphasize correct formats

### **Issue: File created but not where Grace says**
**Cause:** Grace lying about file location  
**Fix:** Already updated MASTER_SYSTEM_PROMPT to tell truth about workspace paths

### **Issue: Python script fails with syntax error**
**Cause:** Specialist generating malformed Python code  
**Fix:** Check error logs (now detailed), share with developer

## üí° Key Insights

### **Why Document Generation Was Failing:**
1. **Missing Libraries** - Runtime didn't have python-docx, openpyxl, etc.
2. **No Verification** - Specialist didn't check if file was created
3. **Wrong Format** - Sometimes created .md instead of .docx
4. **Path Confusion** - Told user "desktop" instead of actual workspace path

### **How We Fixed It:**
1. ‚úÖ **Added Libraries** - All document generation libraries in requirements.txt
2. ‚úÖ **Updated Prompts** - Specialist now knows libraries are available
3. ‚úÖ **Verification Required** - Must run `ls` to verify file exists
4. ‚úÖ **Correct Paths** - Tell actual workspace path

## üìã Checklist for User

- [ ] Pull latest code (`git pull origin main`)
- [ ] **Rebuild Docker container** (`docker-compose build --no-cache`)
- [ ] Start Grace (`docker-compose up -d`)
- [ ] Verify libraries installed (run verification command above)
- [ ] Test Word document creation
- [ ] Test Excel spreadsheet creation
- [ ] Test PDF creation
- [ ] Test CSV creation
- [ ] Verify files are in correct format
- [ ] Verify Grace tells correct file paths

---

## üéØ Success Criteria

‚úÖ **Document generation works if:**
1. Docker container rebuilt with new libraries
2. Grace creates files in correct format (.docx, .xlsx, .pdf, etc.)
3. Files are valid and can be opened
4. Grace tells actual file path (./workspace/...)
5. No "ModuleNotFoundError" in logs

---

## üìû If Issues Persist

**Share these details:**
1. Did you rebuild the Docker container?
2. What's the output of the library verification command?
3. What document format did you request?
4. What error message appeared in console logs?
5. Does the file exist in workspace directory?
6. What format is the file actually in? (check with `file` command)

With the detailed error logging we added earlier, we can pinpoint exact failure points.

**Status:** ‚úÖ Ready for Testing After Docker Rebuild
