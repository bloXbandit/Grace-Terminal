## Summary
Fixed 4 critical issues affecting document generation, profile memory, and file delivery behavior.

**Commit:** 3b13155
**Date:** Oct 19, 2025

## üîß Fix #1: Document Generation (CRITICAL)

### Problem:
- Grace tried to use non-existent "document" action
- Error: "Unknown action type: document"
- Documents were NOT being created
- Exception error: "Reached maximum consecutive exceptions (3)"

### Root Cause:
- Grace was using wrong action type instead of `terminal_run` or `file_generator`

### Solution:
**File:** `src/agent/specialists/routing.config.js`
- Updated data_generation specialist prompt
- Added explicit instruction: "MUST use terminal_run action"
- Added warning: "NOT 'document' action"
- Clarified execution steps

**Result:**
‚úÖ Grace will now use `terminal_run` with Python scripts to create documents
‚úÖ No more "Unknown action type: document" errors
‚úÖ Documents will actually be created

---

## üîß Fix #2: Profile Memory (CRITICAL)

### Problem:
- User told Grace "my name is kenny"
- Grace acknowledged it
- New conversation: Grace doesn't remember the name
- Profile extraction was hallucinating "John" instead of "kenny"

### Root Cause:
- Profile extraction prompt had example value "John"
- LLM was using example instead of actual user input

### Solution:
**File:** `src/agent/profile/extract.js`
- Rewrote extraction prompt with CRITICAL RULES
- Added: "Do NOT use example values - extract ACTUAL values"
- Added: "If user says 'my name is kenny', extract 'kenny' NOT 'John'"
- Emphasized: "ONLY extract EXPLICIT information DIRECTLY stated"
- Removed misleading examples

**Result:**
‚úÖ Profile extraction will use actual user input
‚úÖ No more hallucinations
‚úÖ Names and info will persist across conversations

---

## üîß Fix #3: File Delivery Behavior

### Problem:
- Grace claimed files were "placed in workspace"
- User didn't ask for local placement
- Files weren't even created (due to Fix #1)

### Root Cause:
- Unclear guidance about file delivery behavior

### Solution:
**File:** `src/agent/prompt/MASTER_SYSTEM_PROMPT.js`
- Added new section: "FILE CREATION & DELIVERY"
- Clarified default behavior: Files in sandbox, provide download/content
- Only save locally if user explicitly requests it
- Added warnings against false claims

**File:** `src/agent/specialists/routing.config.js`
- Updated data_generation specialist
- Added: "File delivery - Files are created in sandbox"
- Added: "NEVER claim workspace placement unless user asked"

**Result:**
‚úÖ Grace will be honest about file locations
‚úÖ Default: Sandbox delivery with download link
‚úÖ Local placement only when explicitly requested

---

## üîß Fix #4: Action/Tool Name Verification

### Problem:
- Need to ensure all specialists use correct action/tool names

### Solution:
- Verified all specialists in routing.config.js
- Confirmed correct tool references:
  - ‚úÖ terminal_run (for code execution)
  - ‚úÖ file_generator (for file creation)
  - ‚úÖ p6xer_tool (for P6/XER analysis)
  - ‚úÖ web_search (for research)
- All specialists have proper tool instructions

**Result:**
‚úÖ All specialists use correct tool names
‚úÖ No more "Unknown action type" errors

## üìä Testing Checklist

After rebuild, test these scenarios:

### Document Generation:
- [ ] "make me a word doc" ‚Üí Should create .docx file
- [ ] "create an excel spreadsheet" ‚Üí Should create .xlsx file
- [ ] "generate a PDF" ‚Üí Should create .pdf file
- [ ] Verify no "Unknown action type: document" error
- [ ] Verify file is actually created (not just claimed)

### Profile Memory:
- [ ] Tell Grace your name in chat mode
- [ ] Start new conversation in task mode
- [ ] Ask "do you know my name?" ‚Üí Should say yes with correct name
- [ ] Verify profile persists across modes (chat, task, auto)

### File Delivery:
- [ ] Create a file without specifying location
- [ ] Grace should say "created in sandbox" or provide download
- [ ] Grace should NOT claim "placed in workspace" unless asked
- [ ] Ask to "save to my desktop" ‚Üí Then should save locally

### Exception Handling:
- [ ] No "Task exception terminated" errors
- [ ] No "Reached maximum consecutive exceptions" errors
- [ ] Clean execution logs

## üéØ Expected Improvements

1. **Document Generation Works** - Files actually created
2. **Profile Memory Works** - Names and info persist
3. **Honest File Delivery** - Accurate location reporting
4. **No More Exceptions** - Clean execution

## üìù Files Modified

1. `src/agent/specialists/routing.config.js` - Data generation specialist
2. `src/agent/profile/extract.js` - Profile extraction logic
3. `src/agent/prompt/MASTER_SYSTEM_PROMPT.js` - File delivery guidance
4. `CRITICAL_FIXES_NEEDED.md` - Issue documentation (new)

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. Wait for rebuild to complete
2. Reinstall Python libraries in runtime sandbox
3. Test all scenarios above
4. Verify fixes work as expected
5. Report any remaining issues
