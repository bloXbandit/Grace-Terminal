# Fixes Applied - Grace AI Build

## üêõ Issues Fixed

### 1. Frontend Error: Missing `emitter` Import ‚úÖ
**Error**: `ReferenceError: Can't find variable: emitter` in `see-agent.js:183`

**Fix**: Added missing import statement
```javascript
import emitter from '@/utils/emitter';
```

**File**: `/frontend/src/services/see-agent.js`

---

### 2. Grace Being Too Proactive ‚úÖ
**Issue**: Grace starts planning and building tasks based on vague or exploratory requests

**Fix**: Updated thinking template to require clarification before starting work

**Changes**:
- Added "VAGUE or EXPLORATORY request" detection
- Grace now asks clarifying questions instead of assuming requirements
- Only proceeds with implementation when given clear, specific instructions
- Added "Avoid Premature Planning" section with explicit guidelines

**File**: `/src/template/thinking.txt`

**New Behavior**:
- ‚ùå Before: "help me with X" ‚Üí Grace starts building immediately
- ‚úÖ After: "help me with X" ‚Üí Grace asks "What specifically would you like me to build? What features?"

### 3. Message Bubble Combining Issue ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Issue**: User prompts and AI responses sometimes appear in the same message bubble

**Status**: Investigated - message handling logic appears correct

**Root Cause**: Likely a timing issue in the SSE stream processing or message state management

**Recommendation**: Monitor in production. If issue persists, will need to:
1. Add message role validation in `ChatTree.vue`
2. Ensure `is_active` flag is properly set for each message
3. Add defensive checks in message rendering

## üîß Additional Context

### Grace's Sandbox Preference
Grace prefers using the sandbox for code execution (this is by design and correct behavior). However, she should:
- ‚úÖ Respect explicit user requests to access local system
- ‚úÖ Ask for confirmation when unsure about execution context
- ‚úÖ Explain why sandbox is recommended for safety

### Task Detection Improvements
The thinking template now includes:
1. **Question Detection**: Answers questions about capabilities without starting tasks
2. **Clarification Step**: Asks for details on vague requests
3. **Explicit Confirmation**: Only proceeds with clear, specific instructions

---

## üìù Files Modified

1. `/frontend/src/services/see-agent.js` - Added emitter import
2. `/src/template/thinking.txt` - Enhanced intent detection and clarification logic
3. `/src/agent/prompt/generate_title.js` - Force English titles (previous fix)
4. `/frontend/src/components/markdown/markdown-it-think.js` - Collapsed thinking notes (previous fix)
5. `/frontend/src/view/lemon/message/Planing.vue` - Collapsed planning steps (previous fix)

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Rebuild Docker image** with these fixes
2. **Test scenarios**:
   - Vague request: "help me build something"
   - Specific request: "build a React todo app with local storage"
   - Question: "can you access my local files?"
3. **Monitor message bubble behavior** in production
4. **Continue SEAL implementation** after verification

## üéØ Expected Behavior After Fixes

### Scenario 1: Vague Request
**User**: "help me with a website"
**Grace**: "I'd be happy to help! To build the best website for you, I need more details:
- What type of website? (portfolio, e-commerce, blog, etc.)
- What features do you need?
- Any specific technologies you want to use?
- Do you have design preferences?"

### Scenario 2: Specific Request
**User**: "build a React todo app with local storage and dark mode"
**Grace**: *Proceeds with planning and implementation*

### Scenario 3: Question
**User**: "can you access my local files?"
**Grace**: "Yes, I can access your local files when you're working in Task or Auto mode. I can:
- Read and write files
- Execute code in a sandbox or locally (with your permission)
- Browse directories
Would you like me to help with a specific file operation?"

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

1. **Message Bubble Issue**: Needs production monitoring
2. **Local System Access**: Grace may still default to sandbox - this is intentional for safety
3. **Task Detection**: May need fine-tuning based on real user interactions

**Build Date**: 2025-10-17
**Version**: Custom Build with SEAL Foundation
