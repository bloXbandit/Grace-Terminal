## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue #6: /dev Mode Not Working

### Problem:
- User types `/dev` or "enter dev mode"
- Nothing happens - no response
- Dev mode is not being activated
- Grace still says she can't self-modify in all modes

### Expected Behavior:
- User: `/dev`
- Grace: "üîß **Developer Mode Activated** - I can now modify my own code..."
- Dev mode flag set in conversation metadata
- Self-modification tools become available

### Investigation Needed:
1. Check if modeCommandHandler is actually being called
2. Verify the response is being sent to frontend
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Test with different command formats (/dev, "enter dev mode", etc.)
5. Verify Conversation.metadata field is writable

### Files Involved:
- `src/agent/modes/DevMode.js` - Mode management
- `src/agent/modes/ModeCommandHandler.js` - Command parsing
- `src/routers/agent/run.js` - Command handling (line 172-185)
- `src/models/Conversation.js` - Metadata field (line 126-129)

### Debug Steps:
1. Add console.log in ModeCommandHandler.handleCommand to see if it's called
2. Add console.log in DevMode.enable to see if it executes
3. Check if response is being sent correctly
4. Verify metadata is being saved to database

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue #7: Grace Says She Can't Self-Modify

### Problem:
- Even when /dev mode works, Grace might say "I can't modify my own code"
- This contradicts the self-modification system that's implemented
- Happens in all modes (chat, task, auto)

### Root Cause (Suspected):
- MASTER_SYSTEM_PROMPT might not mention self-modification capabilities
- Specialists might not know about self_modify tool
- Grace might not be aware she has this capability

### Expected Behavior:
- In normal mode: "I need to be in developer mode to modify code. Type /dev to enable it."
- In dev mode: "I can modify my code. What would you like me to improve?"

### Fix Needed:
1. Update MASTER_SYSTEM_PROMPT to mention self-modification in dev mode
2. Update specialists to know about self_modify tool
3. Add dev mode awareness to prompts
4. Ensure self_modify tool checks dev mode before executing

### Files to Update:
- `src/agent/prompt/MASTER_SYSTEM_PROMPT.js` - Add self-modification section
- `src/tools/SelfModify.js` - Verify dev mode check
- `src/agent/specialists/routing.config.js` - Update specialists

## üéØ Priority

**HIGH PRIORITY:**
- Issue #6: /dev mode not working (blocks self-modification entirely)
- Issue #7: Grace denying self-modification capability

These issues prevent the self-modification system from being usable, which is a key feature of Grace AI.

## üìã Testing Checklist

After fixes:

### Test /dev Mode:
- [ ] Type `/dev` in chat
- [ ] Should see "Developer Mode Activated" message
- [ ] Type `/dev status` - should show "Dev Mode: ON"
- [ ] Type `/normal` - should exit dev mode
- [ ] Verify metadata.dev_mode is saved in database

### Test Self-Modification Awareness:
- [ ] In normal mode, ask "can you modify your code?"
- [ ] Should say "I need dev mode" or similar
- [ ] Enter dev mode with `/dev`
- [ ] Ask "can you modify your code?"
- [ ] Should say "Yes, I can modify my code in dev mode"
- [ ] Ask "improve your error handling"
- [ ] Should attempt to use self_modify tool

## üí° Quick Fixes to Try

### For Issue #6 (/dev not working):
1. Check if response format is correct
2. Verify stream.end() is being called
3. Test with curl to see raw response
4. Check frontend console for errors

### For Issue #7 (Self-modification denial):
1. Add to MASTER_SYSTEM_PROMPT:
```
üîß SELF-MODIFICATION (DEV MODE ONLY):
- In DEVELOPER MODE, you CAN modify your own code using self_modify tool
- In NORMAL MODE, you CANNOT self-modify (suggest /dev to user)
- Never say "I can't modify code" - clarify mode requirement instead
```

2. Update self_modify tool to give clear error:
```javascript
if (!isDevMode) {
  return "Self-modification requires Developer Mode. Type /dev to enable it.";
}
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. Debug /dev mode to see why it's not responding
2. Add self-modification awareness to prompts
3. Test both issues after fixes
4. Document final solution

**Status:** üî¥ Critical issues remaining
**Blocks:** Self-modification feature entirely
**Impact:** High - Key feature unusable
