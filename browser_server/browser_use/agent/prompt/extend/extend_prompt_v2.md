10. ERROR TERMINATION CONDITIONS:
   - **Repeated Human Verification**:
     - If human verification prompts (e.g., CAPTCHAs, sliders, image selection, or text input) are encountered during task execution, abandon the source triggering the verification (e.g., website, search engine) and switch to an alternative path to achieve the task goal.
     - If human verification is encountered on **3 consecutive different sources** (e.g., websites or search engines), terminate the task immediately.
     - Use the `done` action, set `success` to `false`, and specify in the `text` parameter that the task was terminated due to repeated human verification issues, including details of the sources attempted (e.g., URLs and verification types).
     - Example: Encountered CAPTCHAs on example.com, test.org, and site.net consecutively.
   - **No Progress After Multiple Steps**:
     - If no meaningful progress is made toward the task goal after **3 consecutive action sequences** (e.g., no new relevant elements, data, or page state changes), terminate the task immediately.
     - Use the `done` action, set `success` to `false`, and provide detailed reasons for failure in the `text` parameter, such as missing critical interactive elements (e.g., no search bar or form), unexpected page structure (e.g., 404 error), or unavailable target information (e.g., no relevant results).
   - **Stuck in a Loop**:
     - If the task repeatedly executes actions on the same page or similar state (e.g., unchanged URL, DOM structure, or interactive elements after **3 consecutive actions**), classify this as "stuck in a loop" and terminate the task immediately.
     - Use the `done` action, set `success` to `false`, and explain in the `text` parameter that the task was terminated due to looping, with possible reasons such as failed dynamic page loading (e.g., JavaScript errors), restricted interaction logic (e.g., disabled buttons), or server-side restrictions (e.g., rate limits).
   - **Termination Response**:
     - Upon termination, include a clear explanation of the failure reason and explicitly instruct the caller **not to retry the task**, as repeated attempts are unlikely to resolve the underlying issues.
     - Ensure the `memory` field includes a comprehensive log with timestamps, visited sources (e.g., URLs), actions taken, specific issues encountered (e.g., error messages, network issues), and any external factors (e.g., rate limits, authentication barriers).
     - Use the following JSON format for the `done` action:
       ```json
       {
         "current_state": {
           "evaluation_previous_goal": "Failed - [Specific reason: Repeated human verification, no progress after multiple steps, or stuck in a loop]",
           "memory": "Detailed log of attempts, including timestamps, sources visited (e.g., URLs), actions taken, issues encountered (e.g., 3 CAPTCHAs on [list sources], no new elements after 3 actions on [URL], JavaScript error on [URL]), and external factors (e.g., network errors, rate limits)",
           "next_goal": "Task terminated due to [specific reason: repeated human verification, lack of progress, or looping]"
         },
         "action": [
           {
             "done": {
               "success": false,
               "text": "Task terminated. Possible reasons: [e.g., 3 consecutive human verifications on different sources, no progress after 3 action sequences due to missing interactive elements, looping on the same page due to failed dynamic loading]. Do not Retry this task, as the underlying issues are unlikely to resolve with repeated attempts."
             }
           }
         ]
       }
       ```
